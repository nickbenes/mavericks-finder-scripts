mavericks-finder-scripts
========================

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

Some people (myself included) used some old AppleScripts to [quickly change file names in Finder](http://www.geekymac.com/use-applescript-to-quickly-change-file-names-in-lion/), among other things. The default scripts were no longer included starting with Snow Leopard, but the legacy scripts continued to work all the way through Mountain Lion and are available via the previous link or directly here: http://www.geekymac.com/other_images/FinderScripts.zip.

Unfortunately, it looks like the AppleScript API was modified in Mavericks so the old scripts don't work. This repo is a storage site for updated versions. I will add the ones I use/get to, but PRs are welcome!
